# Air Quality Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a script that automatically fetches air quality data from GIOS sensors measuring **PM10**, **PM2.5**, and **CO** levels across Poland. The script runs every **3 hours** using **GitHub Actions** and updates an **ArcGIS dashboard** with the latest data.

## Dashboard

The latest air quality data is visualized on an interactive ArcGIS dashboard:
